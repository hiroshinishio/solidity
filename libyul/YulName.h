/**
 * Yul Name repository.
 *
 * A database of numerical identifiers for Yul nodes in an AST (`YulName`s). Identifiers can be
 *
 *  - 'defined', i.e., they are equipped with a string label, which can be retrieved by a call to `labelOf(yulName)`;
 *  - 'derived', i.e., they don't possess a string label but have a parent yul name which is either also derived or
 *    defined. All dependency chains of derived labels terminate in a defined label.
 *
 * Such derived identifiers can be introduced, e.g., during certain optimization steps. If the AST (or segments thereof)
 * should be printed and/or the string label of identifiers should be retrieved which are still in derived state,
 * a call to `generateLabels(identifiers)` changes the status of all derived labels to defined and generates
 * unique labels for all identifiers provided to the method. The generated labels are based on their parents.
 *
 * The second purpose of the YulNameRepository is acting as a proxy for a `yul::Dialect`. Builtins as well
 * as types are mapped to entries in the repository and can be queried using corresponding methods.
 *
 * There is the special case of verbatim functions.
 * verbatim functions are builtin functions which are already variable, therefore they are derived from a common
 * ancestor `PredefinedHandles.verbatim` but don't need a label generated for them, as the label is already
 * defined by their number of inputs and outputs
